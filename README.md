Live coding interviews or homework :movie_camera:
Scripts developed in python 3.9 :snake:. Other stuff may be in JS.

There are homework and live-coding challenges. Inside, each file/folder corresponds to a task that had some instructions for a task to be completed. Instruction remains private. Here I'm sharing my work on some task during different interview processes. Seems that companies at least require you to be able to connect an API, process the requests and do an extra step (processing, calling another API with the results, etc.). So, expect at least 3 points and be prepared for them: API, data manipulation and HTML/web tools are key to be successful on these challenges. Also, I've seen web scrapping as something quite popular to measure the HTM/web tools knowledge during interviews processes.

Some of the feedback I've received was to modularize and encapsulate functions so code it's easier to read/maintain. This is a thing I've taken into account in further processes. This was a helpful tip for other processes.

Private API keys have been removed to keep privacy. Instructions of each task have not been uploaded, for privacy reasons.
